## Merge Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
   layer when doing a build.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of changes to the interface, this
   includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and
   container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the
   new version that this Merge Request would represent. The versioning scheme we
   use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

   other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request
   the second reviewer to merge it for you.
